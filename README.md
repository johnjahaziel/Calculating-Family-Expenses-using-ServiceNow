Requested a personal developer instance and received login credentials by email.

Logged into the ServiceNow instance and began configuration.


Step 2 – Creating a New Update Set

Amount (Integer)

Expense Details (String, max length 800)



Step 5 – Auto-Generating Number Field

Enabled auto-generation for the Number field using “Get Next Padded Number.”
